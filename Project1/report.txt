For step 5, I entered numbers that did not add up: 10 total surveyed, 20 approve, 20 disapprove. The program outputs 200% approve and 200% disapprove, which doesn't add up to 100%. Also, when the number of people that approve equal the number of people that disapprove, the program outputs "More people disapprove than approve" even though the number is equal.
For the logic error, I swapped around the integers (numApprove, numDisapprove, numSurveyed) in the comparisons. So pctApprove was changed to equal 100*numApprove/numDisapprove, pctDisapprove was changed to 100*numSurveyed/numDisapprove, and I swapped numApprove and numDisapprove in the comparison to see if more people approve or disapprove. So with the inputs 10, 20, and 20, 100% of people approve, 50% disapprove, and more people disapprove than approve.
For the compile errors, I changed an instance of numSurveyed to numsurveyed, which resulted in "undeclared identifier." I also removed a semicolon, which resulted in a syntax error, "missing ';' before '}.'"
