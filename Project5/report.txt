The only notable obstacle in this project was making sure letters weren't double counted. Solved it by using arrays to store already used positions.

main
	get words and if no words are loaded, print out error and terminate
	take in number of rounds from user
	loop that number of times
		get random word (index)
		print intial game info
		runOneRound(...)
		keep track of and print average, max, and min and print


runOneRound
	loop until correct	
		take probe word input and check validity
			between 4-6 lowercase letters and is in the wordList
			if not valid, print message and take new probe
		if the word matches, return tries
		otherwise, generate a clue
		
		generateClue


generateClue
	use two arrays to keep track of used positions
	loop through the indices once to check for stars
		mark used positions
	loop again to check for planets
		another loop to check each letter against all the letters of the other word
			increment planets if any letter matches AND the letter is not already used
				mark used positions
